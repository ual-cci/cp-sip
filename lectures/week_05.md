## Why version control?

> Wait, make sure you "Save As" with a different filename before you make those changes!

- Changes are constantly made to software
- We need to have a record of these changes
- Multiple people can work on the same project
- We need tools/programs to allow to make sense of all these changes

There are lots of version control programs out there. These days git is the most popular.

## git & GitHub

The git project was started by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, to be used as the version control system for Linux. git is a program that tracks and saves changes to your project in an efficient way. It is extremely powerful and has lots of features, but we'll be using just a few to begin with.

GitHub is an online service which acts as a `remote` for your repository. It also integrates *social* features, so you can follow and star people and their repositories. In the simplest case you can use it as a "backup".

- `push`
